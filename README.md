# Racession_analysis
This project conducts a comprehensive recession analysis by examining key economic indicators to predict and understand economic downturns. A recession is typically defined as a significant decline in economic activity, spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months. It is often identified by a decline in GDP, rising unemployment, reduced consumer spending, and other financial stress indicators.
